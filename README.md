# kube-state-metrics

Giant Swarm offers a kube-state-metrics app which is installed in workload clusters by default.

Here, we define the kube-state-metrics chart with its templates and default configuration.

## Installation

This app is already installed in your workload cluster by default and therefore not meant to be installed manually.
